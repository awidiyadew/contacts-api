      "content": "Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson not to be \"a coward\" about facing public scrutiny.\n\nMr Hunt said he was \"not interested\" in his private life but he should \"man up\" and debate with him on TV this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson has warned the UK will face a \"democratic explosion\" if it does not leave the EU by 31 October.\n\nBut Mr Hunt challenged him to reveal whether he would call a general election if MPs refused to allow the UK to leave without a deal on that date.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Theresa May failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament earlier this year, the date of the UK's departure for the EU was moved to 31 October.\n\n'Attacks'\nMr Johnson is under pressure to answer questions about a row with his partner in the early hours of Friday which led to police being called to his London home.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it will not be taking any further action over the incident and his supporters have rallied around him. Former International Development Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recording of the argument, given to the Guardian newspaper, was part of a \"politically-motivated series of attacks\".\n\n\"That is not the type of behaviour that you'd expect in our country, that's the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern bloc,\" she added.\n\nMr Johnson refused to answer questions about the incident at a hustings event on Saturday, instead insisting his stance on Brexit was what mattered to the public and to the Conservative Party members who will choose the next leader."

The state's disaster management and relief minister Bhanwar Lal Meghwal questioned why organisers had not switched off the power supply in view of the wet weather.\n\nAn investigation has been launched into the incident.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident \"unfortunate\" in a tweet on Sunday, saying his thoughts were \"with the bereaved families\"."

All donations will be refunded.\n\n\"As a company, we are absolutely committed to the fight for equality for LGBTIQ+ people and fostering an environment of inclusivity,\" said spokeswoman Nicola Britton.\n\n\"While we welcome GoFundMe's engaging in diverse civil debate, we do not tolerate the promotion of discrimination or exclusion.\"\n\nFolau is a Christian who argues his contract termination was an act of religious discrimination.\n\nHe had received about A$760,000 (Â£414,000; $530,000) in donations since the page was set up last week, Australian media reported. RA terminated Folau's contract after saying he had breached behaviour standards \"including respectful use of social media\" by making anti-gay posts.\n\nEarlier this month, the star full-back filed a case against RA and Rugby New South Wales at the Fair Work Commission - Australia's national workplace relations tribunal."

I congratulate him and wish him good luck,â Yildirim said.\n\nThe city of 15 million is Turkeyâs economic powerhouse and has been a crucial source of patronage for Islamic conservatives since Erdogan himself won the mayorship a quarter-century ago.\n\nâA household nameâ\n\nImamoglu, of the secular Republican Peopleâs Party, has become a household name since being stripped of his victory, depicting the rerun as âa battle for democracyâ.\n\nâToday our people will make the best decisionâ¦ for the sake of our democracy, for Istanbul and also for the legitimacy of all future elections,â he said after voting.\n\nHis upbeat message under the slogan âEverything will be fineâ is in contrast to the usual aggressive name-calling of Turkish politics.\n\nImamoglu faced Yildirim, a mild-mannered Erdogan loyalist who oversaw several huge transport projects and served as prime minister."

Local Republicans have fled to stop that happening.\n\nThis weekend, the state capitol had to shut down altogether amid apparent security threats from militia groups.\n\nWhy did the politicians flee?\nOregon Democrats are trying to become the second US state to pass an ambitious \"cap and trade\" climate plan.\n\nHouse Bill 2020 would set overall limits on state carbon emissions, with permits or allowances auctioned off to polluting industries.\n\nThe plan aims to encourage businesses to switch to green technology, with the goal of slashing emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.\n\nUnder it, petrol and diesel prices are expected to go up. Republicans say these changes will disproportionally affect rural Oregonians, like farm workers and loggers.
